# Lucina: A Digital Edition

## Editorial Introduction

### The Work and Its Author

The *Lucina* of Aurelius Laurentius Albrisius (Aurelio Lorenzo Albrisio/Albrisi) is a collection of 128 Latin occasional poems preserved in the magnificently decorated Madrid Codex (Biblioteca Nacional, Mss. 6028), completed on August 2, 1474. This parchment dedication manuscript, likely from the collection of Cicco Simonetta, presents a work previously unknown to scholarship—a significant lacuna given its intimate portrayal of literary culture at the Sforza courts of Pavia and Milan in Quattrocento Italy.

The collection comprises a prefatory dedication poem and three books containing 43, 37, and 47 poems respectively, totaling 2,224 verses. Individual poems range from epigrammatic couplets to substantial compositions of 124 verses, employing diverse classical meters including hendecasyllables, elegiac distichs, and Horatian strophic forms (sapphic and asclepiadean stanzas).

Albrisius, born circa 1440-1445 in Cremona, studied canon law in Perugia before serving as tutor to Cicco Simonetta's sons. His career culminated in his coronation as poet laureate by Emperor Frederick III (1468/69 in Rome), likely arranged through Bishop Giovanni of San Lamberto. Following his studies, he received ecclesiastical preferment and was ordained priest, possibly by Bishop Giovanni Campesio of Piacenza (d. 1474). Despite being married with four children (his wife apparently predeceasing him), Albrisius constructs in *Lucina* a literary autobiography centered on youthful passion.

### Literary Architecture and Narrative

While ostensibly unified by the poet's love for a woman named Lucina, the collection encompasses a heterogeneous array of occasional poetry: panegyric epistles, funeral laments, invectives, consolations, epitaphs, Heroidean letters, dietary recommendations, resignation requests, prayers, celebrations of friendship, and extensive poetological reflections. This generic diversity reveals the work's dual function as both literary autobiography and professional portfolio (*Bewerbungsmappe*) for patronage.

The three-book structure traces a carefully constructed narrative arc. Book I chronicles the poet's first sight of Lucina at the church of San Francesco (while heading to law studies, *studiorum ad iura meorum*), his concealed passion, love-sickness, conflict with a rival (Franciscus Varensis), and the tension between love poetry, spiritual songs, and legal studies. Book II, containing fewer love poems, culminates in poem II.37's highly erotic banquet scene where Albrisius and Lucina consummate their passion. Book III stages the poet's renunciation of secular love: Bishop Giovanni promises him a benefice conditional upon abandoning love poetry, leading Albrisius to abjure Cupid and "lock away" Lucina. Significantly, in III.9 he retrospectively claims Lucina remained virgin, morally rehabilitating the narrative, while the final poem (III.47) confirms his transformation into priest and confessor (*custos rigidus... et sacerdos*).

The prefatory poem defends this youthful love as a temporally bounded episode—begun at age twenty, fulfilled (*concessis*), then abandoned for theological studies. Albrisius insists on the narrative's authenticity, claiming identity between lyrical speaker and historical author, though the literary sophistication of this claim remains deliberately ambiguous.

### Literary Models and Contexts

Albrisius draws extensively on classical and Renaissance traditions. From antiquity: Ovid's *Amores* provides the essential model for Lucina herself and numerous motifs; Tibullus (Delia) and Propertius (Cynthia) offer elegiac precedents; Catullus influences meter and diction; Martial inspires the witty epigrams and invectives; Horace shapes both strophic forms and the Maecenas-topos (Cicco Simonetta as "alter Maecenas").

Petrarch remains the primary Renaissance influence. The collection's structure echoes both the *Canzoniere* (love theme, autobiographical claims, metrical variety) and especially the *Epistulae metricae* (three-book division, real addressees, private themes, love's overcoming). The opening window scene explicitly parallels Petrarch's first encounter with Laura at church, establishing the work's literary genealogy while claiming experiential authenticity.

### Historical and Social Networks

The collection maps the intellectual and political networks of the Sforza courts circa 1470. The work is dedicated to Cicco Simonetta, secretary to Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza, with Book II addressed to his eldest son Gian Giacomo and Book III to Bishop Giovanni of San Lamberto. Individual poems address over fifty named individuals: ecclesiastical and secular dignitaries, ducal administrators, and literati, primarily from Pavia and Milan, with connections to Cremona and Ferrara. The Simonetta family and their relations by marriage (particularly the Visconti and Torelli) feature prominently.

As historical source, *Lucina* provides intimate details about political actors and court culture. As literary monument, it exemplifies the Petrarchan *carmina* tradition—a favored genre for Quattrocento poets seeking patronage through displays of technical versatility and social connection.

### Editorial Principles

This digital edition presents a diplomatic transcription of the Madrid Codex, preserving original orthography and verse lineation while expanding abbreviations (marked in italics) and regularizing punctuation for modern comprehension. Capitalization follows manuscript usage. Given the manuscript's status as an authorial presentation copy with minimal textual corruption, emendation is limited to manifest scribal errors, with all interventions documented in the apparatus.

The edition prioritizes both scholarly precision and accessibility through multiple presentation modes. Users may toggle between diplomatic and normalized transcriptions, access integrated commentary layers (paleographic, literary, historical, prosopographical), and navigate the collection through various indices: by addressee, genre, meter, first lines, or attempted chronological reconstruction. Each poem and verse carries persistent identifiers to ensure stable citation.

### Digital Implementation

Following Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) P5 Guidelines, the edition employs a documented XML schema optimized for occasional poetry collections. The encoding captures structural divisions (books, poems, stanzas, verses), metrical schemes, addressee identification with prosopographical data, genre classifications, and multi-layered apparatus entries. Named entities are linked to authority files, while literary allusions connect to digital editions of source texts where available.

The interface enables non-linear exploration suited to the collection's heterogeneous nature. Network visualizations illuminate social connections among addressees, geographical mapping situates the poems across Northern Italy, timeline visualizations attempt chronological reconstruction, and parallel text display facilitates comparison with classical and Renaissance models. Advanced search functions support investigations across formal, thematic, and prosopographical dimensions.

### Manuscript Description

**Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional, Mss. 6028**  
Parchment, 176 folios, 220 × 145 mm  
Written in humanistic script, single column, 20 lines per page  
Decorated with illuminated initials, marginal ornaments, and coat of arms (likely Simonetta)  
Colophon: "Finita et perfecta II Augusti MCCCCLXXIIII"

Two additional manuscripts preserve fragments of Albrisius's work:
- **Florence, Biblioteca Riccardiana 1458**: Contains two poems, one duplicating *Lucina* II.15
- **Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana E 12 sup.**: Astronomical texts copied by Albrisius in 1476, including occasional verses

The unique transmission of the complete *Lucina* in a single luxury manuscript suggests its intended audience was the exclusive circle of the Sforza court rather than broader circulation.
