# Lucina: A Digital Edition

## Editorial Introduction

### The Work and Its Author

The *Lucina* of Aurelius Laurentius Albrisius (also known as Aurelio Lorenzo Albrisio/Albrisi) is a collection of 128 Latin occasional poems, previously almost unknown to scholarship. The work survives primarily in the magnificently decorated Madrid Codex (Biblioteca Nacional, Mss. 6028), a luxurious parchment dedication manuscript completed on August 2, 1474, likely from the collection of Cicco Simonetta. This collection presents an intimate portrayal of literary culture at the Sforza courts of Pavia and Milan in Quattrocento Italy.

The collection comprises a prefatory dedication poem (*praefatio*) and three books (*libri*) containing 43, 37, and 47 poems respectively, totaling 2,224 verses. Individual poems vary dramatically in length, from epigrammatic couplets of just 2 verses to substantial compositions of 124 verses, employing diverse classical meters including hendecasyllables (Hendekasyllabus in Catullan tradition), elegiac distichs, and Horatian strophic forms (sapphic and asclepiadean stanzas).

Albrisius, born circa 1440-1445 in Cremona, studied law, particularly canon law (*Kanonistik*), in Perugia—studies that may have been financed by either Cicco Simonetta or Bishop Giovanni. Before his academic pursuits, he served as tutor to Cicco Simonetta's sons. His career reached its zenith with his coronation as poet laureate by Emperor Frederick III (likely 1468/69 in Rome), an honor arranged through Bishop Giovanni of San Lamberto. Following his studies, he received ecclesiastical preferment and was ordained priest, possibly by Bishop Giovanni Campesio of Piacenza (d. 1474). Despite being married with four children (his wife apparently predeceasing him), Albrisius constructs in *Lucina* a literary autobiography centered on youthful passion, which he claims began when he was barely twenty years old (*knapp zwanzig Jahre alt*).

### Literary Architecture and Narrative

While ostensibly unified by the poet's love for a woman named Lucina, the collection encompasses a heterogeneous array of occasional poetry (*Gelegenheitsgedichte*): programmatic and poetological-literary sociological texts, panegyric epistles, farewell poems, funeral laments, petitions, apologies, invectives, triumph songs, consolations, blessings, epitaphs, Heroidean letters, admonitions, praise of friendship, dietary recommendations, resignation requests, and prayers. This generic diversity, combined with the work's pronounced self-referential and self-reflexive character, reveals its dual function as both literary autobiography and professional portfolio—what might be called a *Bewerbungsmappe*, a popular form of self-presentation for Quattrocento poets seeking patronage.

The three-book structure traces a carefully constructed narrative arc reminiscent of Ovid and Andreas Capellanus:

**Book I** chronicles the yearning for Lucina. The opening poem (I.1) narrates the love-inducing episode: early one morning (*am frühen Morgen*), while heading to his law studies (*studiorum ad iura meorum*), Albrisius first glimpses Lucina at the church of San Francesco. She appears with her beautiful form (*wunderschönen Gestalt*) at the window but withdraws upon seeing him—a scene deliberately echoing Petrarch's first encounter with Laura. Albrisius swears the story is true, claiming that Lucina herself told it to his neighbor. The subsequent poems detail the development of the love story: his concealment of passion, love-sickness, suffering under love, conflict with a rival (Franciscus Varensis), and the tension between love poetry, spiritual songs, and legal studies. Lucina is rarely addressed directly; more often she is spoken about. Book I contains numerous witty and clever epigrams in Martial's style, including satirical poems and invectives.

**Book II** contains significantly fewer love poems and references to Lucina. It culminates in poem II.37's highly erotic scene during a banquet where Albrisius and Lucina consummate their passion—presented as the climax and conclusion of the love story.

**Book III** stages the poet's renunciation of secular love and love for Lucina. After completing his studies (canon law in Perugia), Albrisius pursues an ecclesiastical career. Bishop Giovanni promises him a benefice conditional upon abandoning love and love poetry to turn toward God. Albrisius abjures the god Cupid and "locks away" Lucina. Yet in III.9, he manages to make Lucina once more the object of his poetry by asking her to pray for him, as he suffers physically from the withdrawal despite being spiritually virtuous. Crucially, he mentions here that Lucina always remained a virgin, retrospectively recasting their earlier relationship as non-sexual and absolving himself of moral guilt. The final poem to Cicco Simonetta (III.47) confirms his transformation: he no longer suffers love's torments nor writes love poetry; his muse Euterpe restricts his lyre, for he is now priest and confessor (*custos rigidus, focum et sacerdos Vestalem pavitans vigilque servo...*—"a rigid guardian, and as priest I anxiously tend and watchfully preserve the Vestal flame").

The prefatory poem defends this youthful love as a temporally bounded episode—love for Lucina forced him to write these songs in youth, it was his first love that found fulfillment (*concessis*), before he turned to other studies and away from love for her. Albrisius insists on the narrative's authenticity, claiming identity between lyrical speaker and historical author, though the literary sophistication of this claim remains deliberately ambiguous.

### Literary Models and Contexts

Albrisius draws extensively on classical and Renaissance traditions:

**Classical Models:**
- **Ovid** (especially the *Amores*): provides the essential model for the figure of Lucina and numerous motifs
- **Tibullus** (Delia) and **Propertius** (Cynthia): offer elegiac precedents for the beloved
- **Catullus**: influences meter (hendecasyllables) and diction
- **Martial**: inspires the witty epigrams and invectives, particularly in Book I
- **Horace**: shapes both strophic forms (sapphic, asclepiadean) and the Maecenas-topos, with Cicco Simonetta portrayed as a "second Maecenas" (*alter Maecenas*)

**Renaissance Influence:**
Petrarch remains the primary Renaissance model. The *Lucina* references both Petrarch's *Canzoniere* (love theme, allegedly autobiographical nature, metrical variety) and even more clearly the *Epistulae metricae* (three-book division, addressing real persons, private themes, overcoming of love). The beginning of *Lucina* (praefatio, I.1) plays directly on Petrarch's own representations, establishing the work's literary genealogy while claiming experiential authenticity.

### Historical and Social Networks

The collection maps the intellectual and political networks of the Sforza courts circa 1470. The entire collection and Book I are dedicated to Cicco Simonetta, secretary to Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza. Book II is addressed to Simonetta's eldest son Gian Giacomo, while Book III addresses Bishop Giovanni of San Lamberto. Individual poems address a broad spectrum of recipients: ecclesiastical and secular dignitaries, ducal administrators, and literati, primarily from the courts of Pavia and Milan, with some in Cremona and Ferrara. Members of the Simonetta family and their relations by marriage (particularly the Visconti and Torelli families) feature especially prominently.

As a historical source, *Lucina* provides intimate details about political actors and court culture. As a literary monument, it exemplifies the Petrarchan *carmina* tradition—a favored and popular form of representation (*beliebte Darstellungsmöglichkeit*) for Quattrocento poets seeking patronage through displays of technical versatility and social connection. The collection reflects a learned network and refers to concrete occasions, with poems likely based on events from everyday life, even if their degree of reality cannot be fully verified.

### The Madrid Codex and Manuscript Tradition

The Madrid Codex marks a biographical caesura: here Albrisius compiled his poems from his time as teacher and student. With his entry into ecclesiastical service, his production of worldly love poetry likely ended. The collection sketches an autobiography structured as a series of letters.

**Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional, Mss. 6028**
- Parchment, 176 folios, 220 × 145 mm
- Written in humanistic script, single column, 20 lines per page
- Decorated with illuminated initials, marginal ornaments, and coat of arms (likely Simonetta)
- Colophon: "Finita et perfecta II Augusti MCCCCLXXIIII"
- Provenance: Probably from Cicco Simonetta's library

Two additional manuscripts preserve fragments of Albrisius's work:
- **Florence, Biblioteca Riccardiana 1458**: Contains two poems, one also found in *Lucina*
- **Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana E 12 sup.**: Astronomical texts copied by Albrisius in 1476, including occasional verses

The unique transmission of the complete *Lucina* in a single luxury manuscript suggests its intended audience was the exclusive circle of the Sforza court rather than broader circulation.

### Significance of the *Lucina*

The *Lucina* stands as a witness to the literary culture at the Sforza court, offering insights into the life of a barely known humanist, his literary network, his personal experiences (love, study, ecclesiastical career), and his engagement with classical and humanistic models, all presented in an artfully constructed "literary autobiography." The work exemplifies the genre of a Petrarchan *carmina* collection, which likely served as a popular form of self-presentation for Quattrocento poets and functioned as a kind of application portfolio or showcase for potential patrons.

Despite the literary stylization, the collection's grounding in specific occasions and real persons makes it valuable both as a historical document providing intimate details about political actors and as a literary work deserving attention as an example of a brilliant literary epoch.

## Editorial Principles

This digital edition presents a diplomatic transcription of the Madrid Codex, preserving original orthography and verse lineation while expanding abbreviations (marked in italics) and regularizing punctuation for modern comprehension. Capitalization follows manuscript usage. Given the manuscript's status as an authorial presentation copy with minimal textual corruption, emendation is limited to manifest scribal errors, with all interventions documented in the apparatus.

The edition prioritizes both scholarly precision and accessibility through multiple presentation modes. Users may toggle between diplomatic and normalized transcriptions, access integrated commentary layers (paleographic, literary, historical, prosopographical), and navigate the collection through various indices: by addressee, genre, meter, first lines, or attempted chronological reconstruction. Each poem and verse carries persistent identifiers to ensure stable citation.

## Digital Implementation

Following Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) P5 Guidelines, the edition employs a documented XML schema optimized for occasional poetry collections. The encoding captures structural divisions (books, poems, stanzas, verses), metrical schemes, addressee identification with prosopographical data, genre classifications, and multi-layered apparatus entries. Named entities are linked to authority files, while literary allusions connect to digital editions of source texts where available.

The interface enables non-linear exploration suited to the collection's heterogeneous nature:
- Network visualizations illuminate social connections among addressees
- Geographical mapping situates the poems across Northern Italy
- Timeline visualizations attempt chronological reconstruction
- Parallel text display facilitates comparison with classical and Renaissance models
- Advanced search functions support investigations across formal, thematic, and prosopographical dimensions
