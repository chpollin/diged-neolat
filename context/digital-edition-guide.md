# Framework for Scholarly Digital Editions

## 1. Definition and Scope

### 1.1 Definition
A Scholarly Digital Edition (SDE) constitutes an information resource that provides a critical representation of historical documents or texts through methodologies determined by digital paradigms. SDEs distinguish themselves from traditional print editions and simple digitization projects by implementing information systems that transcend the technological limitations of print media.

### 1.2 Delimitation
The following resources do not qualify as SDEs in the strict sense:
- Digitized versions of printed editions without additional scholarly apparatus
- Library or archive digitization projects lacking critical engagement
- Digital resources that fail to meet established scholarly standards
- Publications constrained by print-technology paradigms

### 1.3 Necessary Conditions
Three conditions must be satisfied for a resource to qualify as an SDE:
1. Documentation and justification of editorial methodology with clear description of applied rules
2. Compliance with scholarly requirements for content and quality, including adherence to self-stated rules
3. Implementation of an editorial concept utilizing digital paradigms beyond print technology limitations

## 2. Implementation Requirements

SDEs require structured data modeling using established standards (preferably TEI-XML with ODD documentation), preserved in machine-readable formats with content separated from presentation. The technical infrastructure must provide persistent identifiers (DOI/URN/PURL), stable URLs, version control, and data export capabilities through APIs (OAI-PMH, REST). Underlying XML data must be accessible either per object or as complete datasets, with restricted access requiring explicit justification. All components require clear rights specifications and appropriate licensing (Creative Commons recommended).

## 3. Scholarly Standards

Editorial documentation must comprehensively state principles, transcription guidelines, selection criteria, and textual criticism methodology while identifying all contributors. The edition must clarify its editorial approach (document-based vs. work-based), approach to textual variance, and emendation principles. Core content includes source materials with scholarly transcriptions, bibliographic metadata, and editorial commentary, maintaining verifiable accuracy, declared completeness, and academic rigor. The scholarly apparatus encompasses documentation of textual tradition, variant collation for multi-witness texts, editorial notes, bibliographic references, historical introductions, codicological descriptions, and relevant indices or glossaries.

## 4. Interface and Functionality

The user interface must provide intuitive navigation with immediate content identification, consistent design patterns, responsive display, and WCAG accessibility compliance, ensuring usability without extensive instruction. Access methods include systematic browsing through complete content via multiple organizational paths (chronological, alphabetical, thematic) and both basic and advanced search capabilities with field-specific options and clear documentation. Presentation features encompass research-quality images with zoom and manipulation tools, multiple text views (diplomatic, normalized, reading), parallel text-image display, witness comparison capabilities, and integrated commentary. Citation requirements include persistent identifiers at appropriate granular levels with clear guidelines, stable URLs, and version information, while supporting internal cross-references, external linking, and integration with authority files.

## 5. Digital Implementation

SDEs must transcend print limitations through dynamic content manipulation, non-linear access paths, layered information architecture, and interactive user engagement, potentially including real-time collation tools, relationship visualizations, annotation capabilities, and computational analysis. Technical interoperability requires standards compliance, machine-readable formats, API provision, and research infrastructure integration, while scholarly interoperability demands disciplinary compatibility, contribution to discourse, data reusability, and evaluation-enabling documentation.

## 6. Sustainability

Long-term preservation requires documented strategies, regular backups, migration planning, institutional commitment, repository deposits, version control, and recovery procedures. Ongoing maintenance encompasses technical updates, security patches, error correction, user feedback mechanisms, and performance monitoring, while content development needs clear completion statements, addition/correction procedures, version documentation, and transparent change logs.

## 7. Project Execution

Implementation requires careful planning of scope, resources (financial, personnel, temporal), technical architecture, editorial methodology, and sustainability strategy. The team must combine editorial expertise, technical development capabilities, digital humanities knowledge, project management, and design skills. Development follows iterative phases: conceptual design, pilot testing, full-scale encoding, interface development, quality assurance, publication, and continuous improvement. Success is evaluated through achievement of objectives, scholarly compliance, technical quality, usability, research contribution, digital innovation, and long-term viability, with minimum requirements including methodological documentation, principle adherence, digital functionality beyond print, stable citations, and clear rights statements.
