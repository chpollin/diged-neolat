        "Accept, Cicco, these verses which your poet offers,",
        "A small gift, but given with a grateful heart.",
        "You who, like Maecenas of old, support the Muses,",
        "And nurture poets with your generous hand.",
        "May these humble songs please your discerning ear,",
        "As I sing of love and the flames that burn within.",
        "Lucina shall be my theme, that radiant maiden,",
        "Whose beauty rivals the morning star itself.",
        "Through elegiac verse I'll tell our story,",
        "How Cupid's arrows found their mark in me.",
        "But you, great patron, are the one who makes this possible,",
        "Without your support, my voice would be but silence.",
        "So take these offerings of a grateful client,",
        "Who owes to you whatever fame he gains.",
        "May the Sforza court long flourish under your guidance,",
        "And may poetry bloom beneath your care.",

        "Who dedicates this work to you alone."
